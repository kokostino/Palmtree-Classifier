# ðŸŒ´ Palmtree-Classifier in Progress ðŸŒ´
Step by step building a palmtree classifier

Data used: 
- O(10^3) of my favourite photos of which roughly 10% are palmtrees
- O(0.25*10^3) palmtree images scraped from Instagram
</br>

Steps:
- Pre-processing: Crop and resize images and annotate label (**annotations.ipynb**)
- Simple Neural Network Classifier: Implement a simple 4 layer neural network with numpy (**SimpleNNwithNumpy.ipynb**)
