# ðŸŒ´ Palmtree-Classifier in Progress ðŸŒ´
Step by step building a palmtree classifier

# The Dataset </br>

Data used: 
- O(10^3) of my favourite photos of which roughly 10% are palmtrees
- O(0.25*10^3) palmtree images scraped from Instagram
</br>

Pre-processing: </br>
Crop and resize images and annotate label (**annotations.ipynb**)</br>

# Models </br>
- Logistic Regression
- Simple Neural Network Classifier: Implement a simple 4 layer neural network with numpy (**SimpleNNwithNumpy.ipynb**)
- Convolutional Neural Network (**ConvNetKeras.ipynb**)
- Residual Neural Network
- Transfer Learning
